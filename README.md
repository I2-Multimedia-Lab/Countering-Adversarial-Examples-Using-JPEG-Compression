# Countering-Adversarial-Examples-Using-JPEG-Compression


This is an implementation of our work   ‘Countering-Adversarial-Examples-Using-JPEG-Compression’  

* We add our proposed jpeg defense method in ./utils    
* Thanks for the decent code from EvadeML-Zoo. This work is extended from Feature Distillation(https://github.com/zihaoliu123/Feature-Distillation-DNN-Oriented-JPEG-Compression-Against-Adversarial-Examples) and EvadeML-Zoo (https://github.com/mzweilin/EvadeML-Zoo)
